The game I created is a game called Fight War which is inspired by Space War in the game dindong. The game has a rule that is :
- The game will win if it succeeds in destroying the Alien Boss that appears at the time after 1 minute of play, if the player does not succeed in defeating the Alien Boss until the Alien Boss reaches the layout limit then the player is declared defeated.
- The player has 3 lives, the life will be reduced if hit by a meteor. If the life runs out then the player is declared defeated.
- Aliens have 2 lives, so it takes 2 shots to destroy Aliens
- The meteor will be destroyed with just 1 shot.
